# Ecosystem

The GPU ecosystem in Rust is nascent and complex. It can be challenging to understand
why projects exist and how they compare to others in the space. This section is a
decoder ring for key projects that relate to both Rust and GPUs in some way.

## [rust-gpu](https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-gpu)

Compiles unmodified Rust code to
[SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/spir/) (Vulkan) so that it can run on the GPU.

## [rust-cuda](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA)

Compiles unmodified Rust code to
[NVVM](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvvm-ir-spec/index.html) (CUDA) so that it can run
on the GPU. _Currently unmaintained but stay tuned!_

## [nvptx backend in rustc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/nvptx64-nvidia-cuda.html)

Compiles unmodified Rust code to
[PTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html) (CUDA) so that
it can run on the GPU.

## [CubeCL](https://github.com/tracel-ai/cubecl)

Compute language extension for Rust. Enables annotated Rust code to run on the GPU.

## [krnl](https://github.com/charles-r-earp/krnl)

Safe, portable, high performance compute (GPGPU) kernels. Enables annotated Rust code to
run on the GPU (via Rust GPU).

## [cudarc](https://github.com/coreylowman/cudarc)

Minimal and safe api over the CUDA toolkit. Enables calling CUDA from Rust running on
the CPU.

## [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/)

A safe and portable graphics library for Rust based on the WebGPU API. Enables
communicating with the GPU from Rust running on the CPU.

## [naga](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/tree/trunk/naga)

A source code translator written in Rust that converts between various GPU-specific
shader languages ([WGSL](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/),
[GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language),
[HLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Level_Shader_Language), and
[MSL](https://developer.apple.com/metal/)). These shaders ultimately run on the GPU.

## [ZLUDA](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA)

A drop-in replacement for CUDA written in Rust. Enables using tools and libraries
targeted at CUDA on non-NVIDIA hardware.

## [Asahi Linux GPU drivers](https://asahilinux.org/2022/12/gpu-drivers-now-in-asahi-linux/)

GPU drivers partially written in Rust to add Linux support for Apple GPUs.
