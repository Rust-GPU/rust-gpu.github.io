The [Rust CUDA project](https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-cuda) has been [rebooted after
being dormant for 3+ years](./2025-01-27-rust-cuda-reboot.md).

Rust CUDA enables you to write and run [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
kernels in Rust, executing directly on NVIDIA GPUs using [NVVM
IR](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvvm-ir-spec/index.html).

Much has happened since the reboot announcement and we wanted to give an update.

## Short-term goals

As a reminder, our short-term goals were to stabilize and modernize the Rust CUDA
project by updating dependencies, merging outstanding PRs, and closing outdated issues.

### Update to a newer Rust toolchain

Rust-CUDA is a collection of crates, one of which is
[`rustc_codegen_nvvm`](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/tree/main/crates/rustc_codegen_nvvm).
This crate plugs directly into the Rust compiler to generate [NVVM
IR](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/nvvm-ir-spec/index.html), which NVIDIA's tools then
compile down to GPU-executable code. It's the magic that makes Rust-on-GPU happen and
allows your Rust code to call existing CUDA libraries (anything compiled into
[PTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution)).

Because `rustc_codegen_nvvm` relies heavily on the Rust compiler's internals, it needs
to exactly match with a particular compiler version. Up until recently, Rust-CUDA was
stuck on a very old nightly versionâ€”`nightly-2021-12-04`. That is **over 3 years old**!

Huge shoutout to new contributor <Gh user="jorge-ortega" /> for [bringing Rust-CUDA
forward to `nightly-2025-03-02`](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/pull/155). With
this update, we've got much better compatibility with the Rust crate ecosystem and
access to new language features.

Jorge used a [draft PR](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/pull/98) put together by <Gh user="apriori" /> way back in 2022 as a guide. Big thanks to both <Gh user="jorge-ortega" /> and <Gh user="apriori" /> for making this leap possible!

### Experimental support for the latest CUDA tookit

The [latest NVIDIA CUDA toolkit is
`12.x`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html). When
Rust-GPU was last maintained only `11.x` was available. Rust-GPU crates would error if
CUDA was less than version `11.x`, but the check also errored on `12.x`. Supporting CUDA
`12.x` is critical as most users install the latest CUDA toolkit.

<Gh user="jorge-ortega" /> tested Rust-GPU with CUDA `12.x` successfully, giving
us confidence to enable initial support. New contributor <Gh user="Schmiedium" /> then
[updated the version check](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/pull/165), and
maintainer <Gh user="LegNeato" /> integrated `12.x` [into CI](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/pull/168).

Support for CUDA `12.x` remains experimental due to limited testing and ongoing codebase
ramp-up. Please [file issues](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/issues) if
encountered!

### Fix CI

Rust-CUDA's CI was broken after three years of inactivity and there was significant
technical debt.

As CI is critically important to quality, we focused on fixing and modernizing it. <Gh
user="jorge-ortega" />, <Gh user="Schmiedium" />, and <Gh user="LegNeato" /> resolved
formatting issues, fixed clippy warnings, updated dependencies, rewrote code, and
addressed linker errors across both Windows and Linux. The [first passing CI
run](https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA/actions/runs/13913964011/) was a huge
accomplishment and a culmination of a lot of debugging and development work.

The Rust-GPU project currently can't run GPU tests on GitHub Actions due to the lack of
NVIDIA GPUs. **If you want to sponsor some CI machines, get in touch!**

Even without GPU tests, CI now provides a critical safety net for future development.

### Merging outstanding PRs

We merged over 16 outstanding pull requests from over 12 contributors as far back as 2022. Some selected changes:

- [#105](https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-gpu/pull/105) by <Gh user="DoeringChristian"
  />: Fixed a double-free caused by incorrect casting, significantly improving memory
  safety. While Rust-CUDA is written in Rust, we interface with CUDA libraries and tools
  written in C/C++ so issues like this can happen.
- [#64](https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-gpu/pull/64) by <Gh user="kjetilkjeka" /> (the
  `rustc` ptx backend maintainer): Added pitched memory allocation and 2D memcpy
  support, enabling more efficient GPU memory management.
- [#67](https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-gpu/pull/67) /
  [#68](https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-gpu/pull/68) by <Gh user="chr1sj0nes" />:
  Removed unnecessary `Default` bounds, making the API better.
- [#71](https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-gpu/pull/71) by <Gh user="vmx" />: Added
  support for retrieving device UUID, making GPU resource management easier.

Thank you to all the (old) contributors:

<Gh user="zeroecco" />, <Gh user="skierpage" />, <Gh user="Vollkornaffe" />, <Gh user="Tweoss" />
, <Gh user="DoeringChristian" />, <Gh user="ralfbiedert" />, <Gh user="vmx" />, <Gh user="jac-cbi" />
, <Gh user="jounathaen" />, <Gh user="WilliamVenner" />, <Gh user="chr1sj0nes" />
, <Gh user="kjetilkjeka" />

Sorry for your changes languishing for so long! We hope you come back and contribute
again soon.

### Merging new PRs

Since the reboot, we merged over 22 new pull requests from over 7 new contributors:

<Gh user="Schmiedium" />, <Gh user="LegNeato" />, <Gh user="jorge-ortega" />, <Gh user="alaric728" />
, <Gh user="Jerryy959" />, <Gh user="juntyr" />

Thank you to all of our new contributors!

#### Project cleanups

Rust-GPU maintainer <Gh user="LegNeato" /> went through the project and closed most of the
outdated issues and any pull requests that were no longer relevant. Little things like
tags on GitHub were added to aid discoverablility.

## What's next?

Now that the project is rebooted and stabilized, we can start to look forward. As
mentioned in the [reboot post](./2025-01-27-rust-cuda-reboot.md), this is broadly what
we are thinking:

- **Rust-C++ interop**: Investigate Rust's recent C++ interoperability initiatives to
  see if they can be used to simplify host and library integration for CUDA.
- **Rust community collaboration**: Work with other Rust CUDA projects to consolidate
  and unify host-side tools and workflows where appropriate.
- **PTX backend collaboration**: Coordinate with the [rustc PTX
  backend](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/nvptx64-nvidia-cuda.html)
  team to explore shared infrastructure and evaluate transitioning Rust CUDA from NVVM
  IR to raw PTX.
- **`rust-gpu` collaboration**: Leverage `rust-gpu`'s tooling and compiler
  infrastructure to reduce duplication.

Of course, what's next will largely depend on who shows up and what they want to do!
Rust-GPU is 100% community-driven; none of us are paid to work on it.

## Relation to other GPU projects in the Rust ecosystem

In the reboot post, we mentioned significant opportunities for collaboration and
unification with related projects:

- **[Rust GPU](https://rust-gpu.github.io/)**: This project is similar to Rust CUDA but
  targets [SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/spir/) for [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)
  GPUs.

  Our long-term vision for the two projects includes merging developer-facing APIs to
  provide a unified experience for GPU programming in Rust. Developers should not need
  to worry about underlying platforms (Vulkan vs. CUDA) or low-level IR (SPIR-V vs.
  NVVM) unless doing specialized work. This would make GPU programming in Rust feel as
  seamless as its abstractions for CPU architectures or operating systems.

  Christian Legnitto ([LegNeato](https://github.com/LegNeato)) is one of the maintainers
  for both projects.

- **[`rustc` PTX
  backend](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/nvptx64-nvidia-cuda.html)**:
  The Rust compiler's experimental `nvptx` backend generates CUDA's low-level
  [PTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/) IR. We plan to
  collaborate with this effort to determine how it can complement or integrate with
  `rust-cuda`'s NVVM IR approach.

- **[cudarc](https://github.com/coreylowman/cudarc)**: This crate provides a host-side
  abstraction for CUDA programming in Rust. We aim to explore how `rust-cuda` can
  interoperate with `cudarc` or consolidate efforts.

After digging deeper into the Rust-CUDA codebase, we're even more convinced these
opportunities are real. The path to merging Rust-CUDA and Rust-GPU, in particular, looks
shorter and more relevant than we originally expected.

## Call for contributors

We need your help to shape the future of CUDA programming in Rust. Whether you're a
maintainer, contributor, or user, there's an opportunity to [get
involved](https://github.com/rust-gpu/rust-cuda). We're especially
interested in adding maintainers to make the project sustainable.

Be aware that the process may be a bit bumpy as we are still getting the project in
order.

If you'd prefer to focus on non-proprietary and multi-vendor platforms, check out our
related **[Rust GPU](https://rust-gpu.github.io/)** project. It is similar to Rust CUDA
but targets [SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/spir/) for
[Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) GPUs.
